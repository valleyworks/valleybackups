Setting up your AWS account
---------------------------

**ACCOUNT ID**

* Login to your AWS Console and go to "My Account" (https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account) and take note of your **Account ID**

**REGION NAME**

* Navigate to the Glacier service and take note of the current Region (easiest way is to look your current URL, for ex: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com, **Region** would be *us-west-2*

**ACCESS KEYS**

* Navigate to the IAM service -> Users -> *Create new User*

* Take note of the credentials shown

Creating a Glacier Vault
........................

* Run ``valleybackups create_vault <vault_name>`` (this process creates a SNS topic and assigns it to the recently created vault, to enable Notifications)


Create Notification Subscriptions for our Vault
...............................................

When we want to download any file stored in our Vault, we will need to configure a Subscription (basically telling AWS where to notify our app that the file is ready)

* Head to the SNS service on your AWS Console

* In **Topics** choose your recently created Topic (the name is <vault_name>Notification)

* Click on **Create Subscription**

* Follow instructions on http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html


How to use it
-------------


Pick any file you want to backup and push it to AWS Glacier:
    ``valleybackups backup <filename>``

Then list all your backed up files:
    ``valleybackups list``

Retrieve a file from valleybackups by using the ID in the previous list:
    ``valleybackups request 1``

This will generate a job to retrieve the file. It will usually takes hour. Once itâ€™s ready you can retrieve in the folder you currently are by running:
    ``valleybackups download 1``
